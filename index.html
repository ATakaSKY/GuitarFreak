			        <span class="more"> “Alice’s Restaurant” Arlo Guthrie played a nice progression
				of chords that tied up the tune with a bit of flare. I’ve looked all over
				the Internet for someone who had written those chords out, but with no luck.
				So I ended up searching on “chord progression” and came across
				your fine site. After educating myself in the theory of chord resolution,
				I realized that he was playing the I-IV-V sequence with the III chord for
				the IV and V chords. I figured out a nice voicing on the guitar, and ended
				up with a fine sounding progression to finish off a simple 12 bar blues
				song. Thanks again, and I’ll never forget what you taught me!
